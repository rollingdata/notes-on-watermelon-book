## Gerenral formula for linear model


## Linear regression (regression)

scalar form:


vector form:


Parameters:


How to find good estimation for the parameters? OLS

### Details of deriving the solution to OLS


## Logistic regression (classification)

Essentially, logistic regression by nature is a linear model. Note that the log odds for y(logit of y) as a new responce variable z, we can rewrite the formula 

sigmoid function




## Linear Discriminant Analysis


## Multiclass learning problem

The main idea dealing with multilclass learning problem is to divide the problem into pieces of binary classification problems.

There are two mainstream strategies:
1. one vs one
2. one vs all


## Class imbalance

### rescaling 

#### up sampling

#### down sampling

#### threshold-moving


## Miscellaneous
